    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In <em>Quarantine Zone</em>, you are not just a bureaucrat with a stamp; you are the gatekeeper of the last line of defense. Every oversight or act of excessive force has severe consequences. This guide will teach you how to survive. For comprehensive information about inspection tools and their usage, check out our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">complete wiki</a>.</p>
  
      <h2>Part 1: The Inspection Process — Observe Like a Hawk</h2>
      <p>Top inspectors know the rule: <strong>"Observe first, test second."</strong></p>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide01-01.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
  
      <h3>1. Visual Observation (Costs No Resources)</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Gait &amp; Posture:</strong> Watch for limping, twitching, or constant clutching of the stomach/head.</li>
          <li><strong>Facial Features:</strong> Dilated pupils, bloodshot eyes, or vacant stares are strong indicators.</li>
          <li><strong>Skin:</strong> Look for abnormal paleness, black veins, or rashes.</li>
          <li><strong>Sweat:</strong> Excessive sweating usually indicates fever or nervousness.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>2. Efficient Tool Usage</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Thermometer:</strong> Aim at forehead. Anything above <strong>38°C</strong> is a Red Flag.</li>
          <li><strong>UV Light (The MVP):</strong> Scan face and neck. Look for glowing spots, hidden fluids, or veins.</li>
          <li><strong>Body Scanner:</strong> Check for internal foreign objects (bombs) or organ mutations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For detailed information about all inspection tools and their advanced usage techniques, visit our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">wiki section</a> on inspection tools.</p>
  
      <img src="/images/guide/guide01-02.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
      <h2>Part 2: The Art of Decision Making</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Green (Approve):</strong> All metrics normal, documents match.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow (Quarantine):</strong> High temp but no other symptoms? When in doubt, quarantine. Better than an outbreak inside.</li>
          <li><strong>Red (Liquidate):</strong> Obvious zombification features, strong positive UV, or parasites. Caution: Ensure no innocents are in the line of fire.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 3: Base Management — Logistics Save Lives</h2>
      <p>Effective resource management is crucial for survival. Learn more about managing your base resources efficiently by checking our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">resource management guide</a> in the wiki.</p>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Fuel is Life:</strong> Always keep the generator fuel above the safety line. No Power = No Lights + No Turrets. Refuel manually in the morning.</li>
          <li><strong>Ammo Management:</strong> Do not spray and pray. Use pistols for single targets; save heavy ordnance for hordes.</li>
          <li><strong>Upgrade Priority:</strong> Start with Power Capacity and Tool Efficiency. Later, get Wall Defense.</li>
      </ol>
  
      <h2>Part 4: Dealing with Emergencies</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Raiders:</strong> If someone draws a gun, hit the alarm and fire back immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Bribes:</strong> Reject them. People bribing usually hide infection or heavy contraband.</li>
          <li><strong>Night Shift:</strong> Visibility is terrible. Process the queue before sunset to reduce risk.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In Quarantine Zone, you need to be cold. Trust your gut, Inspector. Good luck.</p>`,

    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> While checking paperwork is your day job, staying alive is your night job. As the sun sets, the infected become more aggressive, and raiders see your outpost as a loot box. This guide focuses on the FPS and Tower Defense mechanics to keep your checkpoint standing. For more survival strategies, visit our <a href="/guides" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">guides section</a>.</p>
  
      <h2>Part 1: The Arsenal — Weapons &amp; Defenses</h2>
      <p>Your stamp won't stop a horde. Understanding your hardware is the first step to survival.</p>
  
      <h3>1. Personal Firearms</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Service Pistol:</strong> Your primary tool for "Liquidation" and minor breaches. Ammo is relatively cheap. Always aim for the head; body shots on infected are a waste of resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Rifles &amp; Heavy Weapons:</strong> Save these for <strong>Raiders</strong> or <strong>Mutated Infected</strong>. Do not waste high-caliber rounds on a lone walker.</li>
          <li><strong>Reload Discipline:</strong> Never start an inspection or a night wave with a half-empty magazine.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide02-01.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
  
      <h3>2. Automated Defenses</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Sentry Turrets:</strong> These are the backbone of your defense. They have perfect aim but consume ammo rapidly. <strong>Tip:</strong> Check turret ammo levels after every single wave.</li>
          <li><strong>Combat Drones:</strong> Use these to scout outside the perimeter or flank enemies hiding behind cover. They are expensive to replace, so recall them before they take too much damage.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 2: Threat Matrix — Know Your Enemy</h2>
      <p>Different threats require different tactical responses.</p>
      
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Walkers (Standard Infected):</strong> Slow and predictable. Use the pistol or let turrets handle them if ammo permits. Danger level: Low.</li>
          <li><strong>Runners (Fresh Infected):</strong> Fast and erratic. They will rush the gate immediately. Prioritize them over walkers. Danger level: Medium.</li>
          <li><strong>Raiders (Humans):</strong> The most dangerous threat. They use cover, shoot back, and flank. <strong>Tactics:</strong> Do not stand still in the window. Use the booth's walls for cover and wait for them to reload or move.</li>
          <li><strong>Mutants/Tanks:</strong> Heavily armored infected. They can destroy your walls in seconds. Focus all fire (Turrets + Player) on them immediately.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 3: Fortification Strategy</h2>
      <p>Strategic base upgrades are essential for survival. Learn about the complete upgrade system in our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">base upgrade guide</a>.</p>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Lighting is Key:</strong> You cannot shoot what you cannot see. Upgrade your <strong>Floodlights</strong> early. Shadows are where runners hide.</li>
          <li><strong>Wall Integrity:</strong> Repair your walls every morning. A weakened wall will crumble instantly under a horde attack, letting the infection into the safe zone.</li>
          <li><strong>Kill Zones:</strong> Position your turrets to create overlapping fields of fire at the main gate. Don't spread them too thin.</li>
      </ol>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide02-02.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
  
      <h2>Part 4: Crisis Management</h2>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>The Breach:</strong> If the outer gate falls, do not die trying to save it. Retreat to the inner checkpoint door and hold the choke point.</li>
          <li><strong>Friendly Fire:</strong> Be careful when using explosives or heavy fire near civilians or infrastructure. Damaging your own generator during a fight is a rookie mistake.</li>
          <li><strong>Economy of War:</strong> Sometimes, it is better to buy ammo than food. You can survive a day of hunger; you cannot survive a night without bullets.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A good inspector is meticulous, but a survivor is lethal. Keep your gun clean, your turrets loaded, and your eyes open.</p>`,

    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In the Campaign Mode, the infected are not your only problem. You are stuck between a demanding Command Center, desperate refugees, and opportunistic insurgents. Your choices at the window don't just affect your salary—they determine if your base rebels, starves, or survives the final wave. This guide covers the narrative threats and special encounters. Stay updated with the latest <a href="/news" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">game news</a> for updates on campaign features.</p>
  
      <h2>Part 1: The "Gray Area" Cases (Distinguishing Wounds)</h2>
      <p>One of the most common narrative traps in the game is the <strong>"Injured vs. Infected"</strong> dilemma. You will frequently encounter survivors covered in blood or bandages.</p>
  
      <h3>1. The "Scratch" Defense</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A survivor has a visible wound but claims it is from a fall or a knife fight, not a zombie.</li>
          <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Do not trust their dialogue. Use the <strong>Magnifying Glass</strong> on the wound.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Clue:</strong> A clean cut or bruise is usually safe. A wound with <strong>dark discoloration</strong> or <strong>puss</strong> edges is a bite. If you are unsure, wait. Infected wounds usually trigger a temperature spike within 10 seconds.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide03-01.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
  
      <h3>2. The Silent Carrier</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> They look healthy, act healthy, and plead for entry to see their family inside.</li>
          <li><strong>The Check:</strong> Check their eyes. Even if the skin is clean, the game often hints at infection through <strong>erratic pupil movement</strong> or a "Dazed" status in their behavior description.</li>
          <li><strong>Moral Choice:</strong> If you reject them, they might beg. If you shoot them, you lose Authority. The safest bet is often the "Quarantine" option if available, or a hard "Deny".</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 2: Faction Encounters &amp; VIPs</h2>
      <p>Not everyone is a refugee. You will deal with specific character archetypes that affect your base's story.</p>
  
      <h3>1. The Deserters (Military)</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Clue:</strong> They wear torn uniforms and carry military-grade weapons (which you can confiscate for your defense).</li>
          <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Documents often list them as "AWOL" (Absent Without Leave).</li>
          <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Letting them in provides you with strong fighters for the night defense, but <strong>Command</strong> may penalize your funding for harboring criminals.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>2. The Smugglers</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Clue:</strong> They often have incorrect weight stats on their papers.</li>
          <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> If you catch them, they may offer a <strong>Bribe</strong> (Fuel/Ammo).</li>
          <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> In the early game, Fuel is scarce. It is sometimes strategically necessary to accept a bribe from a clean smuggler to keep your generator running, even if it hurts your reputation.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide03-02.webp" alt="A gatekeeper inspecting a survivor in a Quarantine zone, with a focus on visual observation and tool usage." class="guide-image">
  
      <h3>3. The VIP / Scientist</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Event:</strong> Command will radio you to prioritize a specific NPC.</li>
          <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> They must survive. Even if they have minor irregularities in their papers, you are often forced to let them through. Provide them with an escort (Drone) if possible.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 3: Resource-Based Decision Making</h2>
      <p>Your inspection choices directly impact your Base Management screen. Understanding resource management is crucial - check our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">resource management wiki</a> for detailed strategies.</p>
  
      <h3>1. Confiscation Economy</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Mechanic:</strong> You have the right to confiscate contraband.</li>
          <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Prioritize confiscating <strong>Food Cans</strong>, <strong>Fuel Canisters</strong>, and <strong>Weapon Parts</strong>. Jewelry or cash is useless if you starve.</li>
          <li><strong>Tip:</strong> If a survivor has "Excess Food" marked as contraband, confiscate it immediately. Your camp's hunger meter rises daily.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>2. Labor Force</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Mechanic:</strong> Approved survivors join your camp's population.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance:</strong> More people = More guns on the wall, but also = More mouths to feed.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> If you are low on food, tighten your inspection criteria. Reject anyone who looks weak or elderly (cruel, but necessary for game survival). Only accept able-bodied survivors who can man the turrets.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Part 4: The Night Shift Narrative</h2>
      <p>The game transitions from "Papers, Please" to a shooter at night. Your day choices dictate the night's difficulty.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>The Revenge Raid:</strong> If you executed a member of the <strong>Insurgent Faction</strong> during the day (even if they were infected), their allies might launch a retaliatory attack at night. Be prepared for human enemies with guns, not just zombies.</li>
          <li><strong>The Breach:</strong> If you let a "Silent Carrier" in during the day, you won't face a horde outside—you will face an outbreak <strong>inside</strong> your barracks. This is the worst-case scenario. Always double-check UV scans on suspicious "healthy" people.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In <em>Quarantine Zone</em>, you are writing the story of your camp's demise or survival. Every stamp is a choice between resources, reputation, and safety. Don't be a hero—be a survivor.</p>`,
