    <p>Welcome to a chilling part-time job where fun turns into a nightmare! Five Nights at Freddy's plunges you into the spooky environment of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. By day, it's a paradise for kids, but as night falls, the animatronics awaken. Your mission: survive five nights as a security guard against these relentless creatures. Can you endure the suspense and conquer this famous horror game?</p>
  
    <h3>The Five Nights: A Gradual Descent into Madness</h3>
    <p>Each night intensifies the terror, testing your limits and pushing you to the brink. Be prepared for a relentless assault on your senses and nerves. The animatronics grow increasingly aggressive, and your survival depends on quick thinking and strategic resource management.</p>
  
    <h3>Detailed Nightly Breakdown</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Night 1:</strong> Suspicious movements begin. The animatronics are awakening, testing the waters. Observe carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Night 2:</strong> Freddy and his animatronic friends become more active. Showcase your best defensive skills to stay safe and anticipate their movements.</li>
      <li><strong>Night 3:</strong> The animatronics' movement rate increases dramatically. Their attacks are faster and more unpredictable, requiring heightened awareness.</li>
      <li><strong>Night 4:</strong> Things escalate to extreme levels. A single mistake could be fatal. Stay vigilant and conserve your precious resources.</li>

    <h3>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
    <p>Electricity is your lifeline in Five Nights at Freddy's. It powers the lights and security doors, your primary defenses against the animatronic onslaught.

Utilize it strategically, but be mindful of its electricity consumption. Closing the doors provides immediate protection but drains a significant amount of energy. Open them when safe to conserve power for later threats. Resource management is key - learn more strategies in our <a href="/wiki" style="color: #39ff14; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(57, 255, 20, 0.3);">resource management guide</a>.</p>

    </ol>
