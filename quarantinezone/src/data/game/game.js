    <h2>One Among Zombies</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world teetering on the brink, where the familiar cityscapes are now haunting labyrinths teeming with the infected. Welcome to One Among Zombies, a gripping survival game that thrusts you into the heart of an apocalypse. Unlike the typical run-and-gun zombie games, One Among Zombies focuses on the raw tension, the gnawing suspicion, and the agonizing choices that define survival. Every shadow could conceal a threat, every encounter a potential betrayal.</p>
    
    <h3>Scarcity and Suspicion: The Cornerstones of Survival</h3>
    <p>Resources are critically scarce. Every bullet, every bandage, every morsel of food is a treasure to be guarded jealously. The ravaged city becomes your hunting ground, but be warned: you're not the only one scavenging. Other survivors are scattered throughout the map, each with their own agenda, their own secrets, and their own desperation. Trust is a dangerous luxury. Who can you rely on? Who has already succumbed to the darkness?</p>
    
    <h3>High-Stakes Encounters</h3>
    <p>Each encounter with another survivor is a gamble. Will they offer aid, a temporary alliance against the encroaching hordes? Or are they already lost, their humanity consumed by the primal need to survive at any cost? The decisions you make in these moments will determine not only your own fate but potentially the fate of others as well.</p>
    
    <h3>Gameplay Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tense Atmosphere:</strong> Experience the constant dread of being outnumbered and outgunned.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Decision-Making:</strong> Every choice matters. Conserve resources, assess risks, and choose your allies wisely.</li>
      <li><strong>Unpredictable Encounters:</strong> Never know what to expect from other survivors. Trust is a rare and precious commodity.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Scavenge for essential supplies and learn to make every item count.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How to Survive in One Among Zombies: A Quick Guide</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> The infected are everywhere. Always be aware of your surroundings.</li>
      <li><strong>Conserve Resources:</strong> Ammunition and supplies are limited. Use them wisely.</li>
      <li><strong>Assess Risks:</strong> Before engaging, evaluate the potential rewards versus the potential dangers.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust Sparingly:</strong> Not everyone is your friend. Be wary of other survivors.</li>
      <li><strong>Make Tough Choices:</strong> Sometimes, the only way to survive is to make difficult decisions.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What is the main focus of One Among Zombies?</strong><br>One Among Zombies emphasizes tension, suspicion, and decision-making in a zombie-infested world where resources are scarce.</li>

    </ol>
